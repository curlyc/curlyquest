rpg for arduboy based off loot used with permissions (though according to the wtfpl licence i didnt NEED permission, and as i keep the same licence you can do what the F you want with this code aswell enjoy

was working till i got in a hury trying to make the map not move while mapstate != 0;

also the n s e w indicator dosent change untill after you move (i know how to fix this id just rather not do a million changes when some basic funtionality is not working

that being said there is ALOT of crap in there that is no longer needed, ill get to it eventualy
